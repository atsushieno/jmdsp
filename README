You'll need something that handles "org.openintents.action.PICK_FILE" . If you don't understand it, just install "OI File Manager" http://www.openintents.org/en/node/159

Install my app: http://veritas-vos-liberabit.com/tmp/2010/Jmdsp.apk (it is an unsigned app)

You'd also need some midi files to be copied to your file system. If you try it on a sim, do this:
android-sdk-XXX/tools/adb push yoursongfile.mid /sdcard

Running the app:

	- Tap "Load" text to open an open file dialog. Pick a SMF file.
	- then it tries to load the selected song. When it's done, then
	  it prints "Loaded". The loading process may take a while.
	- Tap "Play" button and then it will play the song. The keyboard
	  may delay right now.
	- Pause and Stop buttons will crash the app right now :(
	- Play button won't work twice.
	- When trying to close the app, it will try to pause, and thus
	  it will crash :(
